📦 Walmart Inbound Forecasting & Demand Modeling

University of Maryland — MSBA Capstone Project
Team project completed with Vinay Chandran & UMD Analytics team.

Forecasted inbound cases and trucks for 100 Walmart stores across 5 departments using 17 months of data.
Built complete data pipelines, time-series splits, CatBoost/XGBoost/ETS/ARIMA models, and operational insights.

🔹 My Key Contributions

Cleaned and merged 275,000+ store–department–day rows

Built time-series train/validation splits for 5 departments

Engineered seasonal, weekly, and weather-related features

Developed models using CatBoost, XGBoost, ETS, ARIMA

Evaluated model performance (RMSE, MAPE) and compared cross-department results

Contributed to slide deck and insights for final presentation

🔹 Pipeline Overview

Data cleaning & merging

Exploratory data analysis (seasonality, trends, anomalies)

Feature engineering

Modeling suite (CatBoost, XGBoost, ETS, ARIMA)

Model summaries + performance tables

Insights & recommendations

🔹 Tech Stack
